Version 1.0.4 (20/11/2025)
    - Updated to .net10.
    - The "ERROR" output now includes the CLPS2C version, the date and time at the moment the input file was compiled.

        - Added case-insensitivity for the "Function" command.
        - Added case-insensitivity for the "Call" command.
    - Added support for parsing nocash symbol files through the "Include" command:
        - The symbol file must have ".sym" extension.
        - A "Set" variable is created for every label and function definition (data directives/global variables are ignored). These variables can be used for normal CLPS2C commands and in assembly scopes.

    - Added the following ERROR values:
        - MISSING_QUOTES
